# EatUp

This project contains a game-like web application which requires
participants to view a series of photos of arthropods, and decide, for
each one, whether or not it is an ant.

Currently, this project is hosted on GitHub pages, where it can be accessed at
https://jimmcl.github.io/EatUp

# TODO
- Split out a generic Javascript library to help other people build their own similar games.
- Some sort of progress indicator.
- Show/email people their scores to motivate them. Just present overall success/fail counts? If so, then we would need to somehow address issues with learning.
- Inform people about "a" and "n" keypresses (Bruno Buzatto)
- Record mouse travel distance - starting position of mouse might skew timing results (Bruno Buzatto)

# Changes
- Made buttons bigger on phones (thanks to Matt Bulbert) - 20-May-2019
