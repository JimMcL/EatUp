# EatUp

This project contains a game-like web application which requires
participants to view a series of photos of arthropods, and decide, for
each one, whether or not it is an ant.

Currently, this project is hosted on GitHub pages, where it can be accessed at
https://jimmcl.github.io/EatUp

# TODO
Some sort of progress indicator?
