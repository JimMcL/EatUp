squiz site for static surrounds, onehelp ticket to get it. //mq.edu...
or else http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~richard/ need science ID

Maybe javascript for front end, send data to a logger eg https://io.adafruit.com/

Static content could be git.io page, or google doc .js file, or MQ website

Maybe store photos on github, (private repositories now free)

Questions

How to motivate people to continue to the end? Easter eggs, ask an
interesting question, then randomly reveal an answer somewhere along
the way?
Show some sort of progress, point system?
How to motivate people to answer correctly? Perhaps feedback for some (obvious) images?
Let them know in advance about leaderboard for top 10?


=====================
Data logging services

Very crude conservative estimate of data requirements: .5KB per image score
Hence, 350 trials @ 30 images/trial ~= 350 * 30 * .5 = 5.25MB

AdaFruit IO https://io.adafruit.com/
Data limit is too low for us. Free service is limited to 30 data points/minute, paid is limited to 60/min. Other than that, it works well (although website is a bit buggy) and was the inital service used to implement this website, using basic REST API

Splunk https://www.splunk.com/
Too expensive, Splunk cloud costs $1012.50/month. I think I need to deploy the other Splunk versions, so not appropriate

Sumo logic https://www.sumologic.com/pricing/apac/
Doesn't seem to have an API for low cost versions, and it seems to
only work on log files (not arbitrary data). I think free allows 500MB per day???

I have looked at the MQTT protocol (and free brokers), but I don't think they provide data storage.

Firebase???
